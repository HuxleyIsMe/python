# Printing pictures to the terminal

I kinda wanted to see how creative we can be with the terminal so I have thought about can we do this?

Essentially I have to remind myself that everything is a square... and we are just going to fill those squares with color
and hey presto we have an image. 

So lets get to it! 

The first step will be working out how big our screen - terminal screen - is. From there we can create a grid of our 'pixels'. 
Once we have our available space of pixels we can focus on trying to scale an image to fit our grid correctly - i prefer things to be centered so i will ensure that the images are centered. Then we can just print out our image grid! which should now represent an image.
